Instructions

1. app.js contains an IIFE called scroll. You need to pass your array into this function on line 106 in order to create the pictures and
	get the scroller ready to spin.
2. You then need to call the spin function when you would like to start the spin. I've done this on line 16 of index.html and have hooked 		it up to a button just for demostration purposes.
